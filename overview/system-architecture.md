# ðŸ’¡ System Architecture

## Layers

The design of Rainbow Protocol's system architecture aims to ensure efficiency, security, and scalability. Here are its main components:

1. **Indexing Layer**: Decentralized indexers identify and parse Bitcoin transactions, extracting transactions that comply with protocol rules and sending them to the contract verification layer for validation.
2. **Verification Layer**: The verification layer consists of a network of multiple Bitcoin light nodes and smart contracts. Its purpose is to validate Bitcoin and Rainbow operation scripts, ensuring their integrity and correctness.
3. **Contract Layer**: Rainbow Protocol defines comprehensive smart contracts for each type of digital asset, handling transfers, exchanges, and destruction of assets, as well as more complex smart contract logic for use in DeFi, SocialFi, gaming, and other Web3 scenarios.
4. **Client Software**: Rainbow Protocol is a peer-to-peer protocol, enabling users to send Bitcoin transactions, check asset balances, and send smart contract instructions using standard web browsers and popular browser extension wallets, all under the protocol's guidelines.

By integrating these components, Rainbow Protocol provides a robust and flexible framework, significantly enhancing Bitcoin's programmability and asset issuance capabilities.

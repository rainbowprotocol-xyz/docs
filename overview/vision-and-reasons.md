# üèÅ Vision and Reasons

## Vision

In today's landscape, investing in cryptocurrencies has become increasingly complex. Bitcoin steadfastly holds its position as a store of value and digital gold. Altering Bitcoin's culture is challenging, and activating Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) is even more so. As a result, individuals often seek opportunities in altcoins, only to face disappointment. Venture capital-backed teams and chains frequently entice investors with ambiguous and meaningless technical jargon, leading to disillusionment. Users engage with purported Layer 2 bridges and chase airdrops, only to witness the inevitable dump following a short-term pump.

There exists a need for a superior and cost-effective approach to liberate us from these deceptions. You deserve the autonomy to deploy and issue coins on the most secure and widely adopted blockchain, coupled with a fee-based solution for sending and storing your assets.

## Why Rainbow

Numerous protocols are built atop Bitcoin, each in varying ways. Rainbow distinguishes itself as an essential and unique protocol due to the following characteristics:

* **Isomorphic States and No Bridge:** Rainbow is conceived as an overlay protocol, ensuring it does not alter Bitcoin's fundamental operations. We integrate and compute the Bitcoin state within Rainbow's execution environment, thereby eliminating the reliance on Multi-Sig bridges.
* **Programmable:** Rainbow assets are implemented as Turing-complete smart contracts, autonomously deployed and decentralized. Developers are empowered to write smart contracts using high-level programming languages, facilitating greater innovation and utility.
* **Permissionless and Fair:** The deployment of Rainbow assets is accessible to anyone through the simple act of sending a Bitcoin transaction. Parameters can be configured to define unique tokenomics, including hard caps, inflation rates, and fair launch mechanisms.
* **Blazing Fast Execution:** Rainbow's Virtual Machine (VM) operates atop the Internet Computer (IC), delivering high performance and scalable solutions for smart contracts. Current transaction speeds are observed to be less than 2 seconds, ensuring swift and efficient execution.

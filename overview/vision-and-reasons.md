# üèÅ Vision and Reasons

## Vision

In today's landscape, investing in cryptocurrencies has become increasingly complex. Bitcoin steadfastly holds its position as a store of value and digital gold. Altering Bitcoin's culture is challenging, and activating Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) is even more so. As a result, individuals often seek opportunities in altcoins, only to face disappointment. Venture capital-backed teams and chains frequently entice investors with ambiguous and meaningless technical jargon, leading to disillusionment. Users engage with purported Layer 2 bridges and chase airdrops, only to witness the inevitable dump following a short-term pump.

There exists a need for a superior and cost-effective approach to liberate us from these deceptions. You deserve the autonomy to deploy and issue coins on the most secure and widely adopted blockchain, coupled with a fee-based solution for sending and storing your assets.

## Why Rainbow

Numerous protocols are built atop Bitcoin, each in varying ways. Rainbow distinguishes itself as an essential and unique protocol due to the following characteristics:

* **Isomorphic States and No Bridge:** Rainbow is conceived as an overlay protocol, ensuring it does not alter Bitcoin's fundamental operations. We integrate and compute the Bitcoin state within Rainbow's execution environment, thereby eliminating the reliance on Multi-Sig bridges.
* **Programmable:** Rainbow assets are implemented as Turing-complete smart contracts, autonomously deployed and decentralized. Developers are empowered to write smart contracts using high-level programming languages, facilitating greater innovation and utility.
* **Permissionless and Fair:** The deployment of Rainbow assets is accessible to anyone through the simple act of sending a Bitcoin transaction. Parameters can be configured to define unique tokenomics, including hard caps, inflation rates, and fair launch mechanisms.
* **Blazing Fast Execution:** Rainbow's Virtual Machine (VM) operates atop the Internet Computer (IC), delivering high performance and scalable solutions for smart contracts. Current transaction speeds are observed to be less than 2 seconds, ensuring swift and efficient execution.

## Continuously Evolving

Rainbow Protocol is an ambitious project, driven not only by our desire and vision for programmable Bitcoin but also by our proactive response to user and market needs. We are committed to the continuous iteration and evolution of Rainbow Protocol, with the following development plans:

1. **Further Integration of Bitcoin Protocol Assets:** We will continuously expand the compatibility of Rainbow Protocol, integrating more Bitcoin-based assets and protocols, including tokens like BRC20, Runes, and Bitmap, to enhance the diversity and vitality of the ecosystem.
2. **Proactive Cross-Chain Asset Integration:** We will actively connect with various public chain assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), expanding the cross-chain compatibility of Rainbow Protocol to offer users a broader range of asset management and trading options.
3. **Expanding Support for More Asset Types:** Rainbow Protocol will extend support to include a wider variety of asset types, such as wrapped Ordinals collections, DMINT collections, and Bitmap, further enriching the functionality and application scenarios of the protocol.
4. **Optimizing User Experience and Developer Tools:** We will continuously improve the user interface and developer tools, making it easier for more users to engage with Rainbow Protocol and enabling developers to efficiently build decentralized applications on Bitcoin.
5. **Advancing Decentralized Governance:** As the protocol evolves, we will gradually introduce decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing the community to have a broader role in decision-making processes. This will ensure that Rainbow Protocol's direction remains aligned with the needs and vision of the community.
6. **Enhancing Security and Scalability:** As Rainbow Protocol develops, we will continuously optimize its security to safeguard user assets. Additionally, we will focus on improving the scalability of the protocol to meet the growing demands of users and application scenarios.

Through these initiatives, we aim to ensure that Rainbow Protocol remains at the forefront of technology, providing users and developers with an innovative platform that continuously evolves. This ongoing evolution is not just a pursuit of technical excellence but also a keen response to user needs and market trends, driving Rainbow Protocol to continually surpass itself in future developments.

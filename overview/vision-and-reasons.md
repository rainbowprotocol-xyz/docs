# üèÅ Vision and Reasons

## Vision

Investment in crypto today is getting harder. Bitcoin stays its way to become a value storage and digital gold thesis, changing Bitcoin's culture is hard, activate BIPs are even harder.&#x20;

People switch to Altcoins for opportunity, but they are often betrayed. VC-backed teams and chains often trick you buying in, with vague and meaning-less technical terms. People interact with so-called L2 bridges and look for airdrops, but then the coins are dumped after the short-term pump.

We need a better and lower cost way to free us from those tricks. You have every rights to deploy and issue the coins on the most secured, widely adopted blockchain and a fee-to-use solution for sending and storing your assets.

## Why Rainbow

There are a lot of protocols built on top of Bitcoin, in various way. Rainbow is one of them, however, there are things make Rainbow unique and a must.

* Isomorphic states and No Bridge:  Rainbow is designed to be an overlay protocol, what it means we do not change the way that Bitcoin works. We share and compute the Bitcoin state inside Rainbow's execution environment, thus we do not use Multi-Sig bridge at all.&#x20;
* Programmable: All Rainbow assets are Turing-Complete smart-contracts, automated deployed and decentralized running. For developers, you can write smart-contracts using high-level programming languages.
* Permission-less and fairness: Anyone can deploy Rainbow Assets simply by sending a Bitcoin Transaction. You can setup parameters to make assets define your own tokenomic types, hard-cap, inflation rate or fair launching.&#x20;
* Blazing fast execution:  Rainbow's VM is running on top of IC, with high performance and scaling solutions for smart-contracts, currently we have seen transaction speed is less than 2 secs.
